Help me build a complete t-shirt e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Read these requirements carefully and follow them step-by-step:

Project Title: ThreadCraft – Custom T-Shirt Store

🧩 Core Features

1. Product Catalog Display

Display at least 6 t-shirt products in a responsive grid layout.

Each product card should show:

Product image

Product name

Price

Description

Size options (S, M, L, XL)

Color options (e.g., Black, White, Blue, Red)

Make sure users can click “Add to Cart” for any product.

2. Shopping Cart System

Add items to the cart with the selected size and color.

Include a cart icon showing the number of items added.

A Cart Page must:

Display all items with images, details, and quantity controls (+/–).

Calculate subtotal, 8.5% tax, and total price automatically.

Allow removing items.

Use localStorage to persist cart data even after page refresh.

3. Checkout Process

Create a Checkout Page with a form to collect:

Name

Email

Shipping Address

Show an order summary of items and prices.

Include a mock payment section (no real processing).

End with an Order Confirmation Page showing a random order number.

🎨 Visual Design Requirements

Use these enhancement prompts:

Header:
“Add a professional header with the store name ‘ThreadCraft’ and navigation links for Home, Products, Cart, and Contact. Use a dark blue or black background and white text.”

Product Cards:
“Improve product cards with a light shadow, rounded corners, bright green ‘Add to Cart’ button, and hover-lift effect.”

Layout:
“Add a light gray page background, consistent grid spacing, max-width for content, and proper margins/padding.”

Cart Page Styling:
“Display cart items neatly, bold total price, red ‘Remove’ buttons, and a matching ‘Continue Shopping’ button.”

When finished, make sure these work:

All 6 products display with images, prices, sizes, and colors.

Cart updates item count correctly and persists on refresh.

Quantity controls change totals accurately.

Checkout form collects info and shows confirmation.

Order confirmation displays an order number.
